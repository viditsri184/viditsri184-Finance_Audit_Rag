Title: SOX Compliance Summary — FY2024 Audit

1. Overview
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) requires management to assess and report on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR). 
Our audit focused on key SOX sections: 302 (Disclosure Controls) and 404 (Management Assessment of Internal Controls).

2. Key SOX Controls Tested
- **Revenue Recognition Control (RRC-01)**: Validates that all revenue transactions are recorded in accordance with GAAP and that cut-off testing ensures completeness and accuracy.
- **Access Management Control (AMC-02)**: Reviews user access rights to financial systems. SOX requires that access to critical financial data be limited to authorized personnel.
- **Change Management Control (CMC-03)**: Ensures that system changes to the general ledger and sub-ledger environments are tested, approved, and documented.

3. Control Testing Results
- RRC-01: Operated effectively with no exceptions.
- AMC-02: One minor deficiency related to terminated user access not being revoked timely.
- CMC-03: No exceptions noted.

4. Remediation Plan
Management will enhance the user de-provisioning process to ensure access removal within 48 hours of employee termination.

5. SEC Guidance Reference
Per SEC Release No. 33-8238, management is required to maintain evidence supporting its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
The SEC also requires timely remediation of any identified material weaknesses before the next annual filing.

7. Entity-Level Controls
These include:

8. SOX 302 Certification
